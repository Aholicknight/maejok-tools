### To build from source:

1. Start by cloning the repository into your project directory

   `git clone https://github.com/maejok-xx/maejok-tools.git .`

2. install the dev dependencies (listed at the bottom of this readme)

   `npm i`

3. Build:

   `npm run build`

**Note**: _Build output will be located at `./dist/maejok-tools.user.js`_

---

### To run in development mode

1. Create a new Userscript in your extension of choice (eg: tampermonkey)

2. Add this

```js
// ==UserScript==
// @name         MAEJOK-TOOLS [DEV MODE]
// @description  Development Version of MAEJOK-TOOLS
// @version      0.0.0
// @icon         https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maejok-xx/maejok-tools/master/public/images/icon.png
// @match        *://*.fishtank.live/*
// @run-at       document-idle
// @require      file:\\\PATH_TO_PROJECT_DIR\dist\maejok-tools.user.js
// ==/UserScript==
```

3. Be sure to replace `PATH_TO_PROJECT_DIR` with the path to your project directory and save the new userscript.

4. Run:

   `npm run build`

Now any time you make changes and save a file, Webpack will rebuild the plugin in development mode. All that's left is for you to refresh Fishtank.live to see your changes.

**Note**: _Build output will be located at `./dist/maejok-tools.user.js`_
